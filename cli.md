# Canasta CLI

The Canasta command line interface (CLI) is a tool written in Go for managing Canasta MediaWiki installations. It handles creation, import, backup, and management of multiple Canasta instances using Docker Compose as the orchestrator. The CLI supports both single wiki installations and wiki farms (multiple wikis in one installation).

## Documentation

Full CLI documentation — including installation, command reference, wiki farm guides, development mode, backup/restore, best practices, and troubleshooting — is maintained in the Canasta CLI repository:
