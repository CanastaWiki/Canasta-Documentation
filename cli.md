# Canasta CLI
The Canasta command line interface, written in Go.

## Installation
First, make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. This is very fast and easy to do on common Linux distros such as Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, and CentOS. By installing Docker Engine from apt or yum, you get Docker Compose along with it. See the following install guides for each OS:

Debian https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/

Ubuntu https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

CentOS https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/

More available at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

Other dependencies:
Git https://git-scm.com/downloads

Then, run the following line to install the Canasta CLI:

```
curl -fsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CanastaWiki/Canasta-CLI/main/install.sh | bash
```

Visit your wiki at its URL, "https://example.com" as in the above example (or http://localhost if installed locally or if you did not specify any domain)
For more info on finishing up your installation, visit https://canasta.wiki/setup/#after-installation.

## Import an existing wiki
Place all the files mentioned below in the same directory for ease of use.

Create a .env file and customize as needed (more details on how to configure it at https://canasta.wiki/setup/#configuration, and for an example see https://github.com/CanastaWiki/Canasta-DockerCompose/blob/main/.env.example).
Drop your database dump (in either a .sql or .sql.gz file).

Place your existing LocalSettings.php and change your database configuration to be the following:
```
Database host: db
Database user: root
Database password: mediawiki (by default; see https://canasta.wiki/setup/#configuration)
```
Then run the following command:

## Restic Documentation
* More about restic at https://restic.net
* The current version is configured for using AWS S3 based repositories
* It uses restic's [dockerized binary](https://hub.docker.com/r/restic/restic)

### How to get started
1. Add these environment variables to your Canasta's `.env`.Follow the steps at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-creds-create to obtain ACCESS_KEY_ID and SECRET_ACESS_KEY
```
AWS_S3_API=s3.amazonaws.com
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_S3_BUCKET=
RESTIC_PASSWORD=
```
2. When using restic for the first time in a Canasta installation please run the following command to initialize a restic repo in AWS S3 Bucket specified in the `.env` file.
```
sudo canata restic init -i canastaId
```
Now you should be able to use any of the available commands.

### Available Restic Commands:
  ```
  check         Check restic snapshots
  diff          Show difference between two snapshots
  forget        Forget restic snapshots

## Uninstall
To uninstall the CLI, delete the binary file from the installation folder (default: /usr/local/bin/canasta)

```
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/canasta && sudo rm /etc/canasta/conf.json
```

Note: The argument "-i canastaId" is not necessary for any command when the command is run from the Canasta installation directory.
